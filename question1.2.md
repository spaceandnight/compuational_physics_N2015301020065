# 第四次作业
* 选做课后习题1.2
* 问题:The position of an object moving horizontally with a constant velocity, v, is described by the equation
><a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac{dx}{dt}=v" target="_blank"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{dx}{dt}=v" title="\frac{dx}{dt}=v" /></a> (1.9)
Assuming that the velocity is a constant, say v=40m/s, use the Euler method to solve (1.9) for x as a function of time. Compare your result with the exact solution.
